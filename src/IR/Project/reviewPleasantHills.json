I asked a young female embloyee next to me for a specific costume, interrupting her conversation with another employee.  She looked at me, hesitated as if it were a bother, but finally called back for my costume.  Without further instruction, she turned and walked away, speaking to another female employee. I asked another parent, who told me to walk around back. I found a table near a set of double doors in the back of the store. It was strewn with bagged costumes and no one there to instruct or ensure the costumes were correct. I found the costume I asked for, in the size I requested, and checked out. It was the most pleasant employee interaction of the excursion. I got home, only to find that part of the costume was missing (wand).

You'll likely wait forever to be seated. Your table will probably be dirty. Your server will probably disappear for almost your entire time there (but not always. I've has some rock star servers here, too. But it is not the norm). Your food will probably take forever to come out, you'll probably never get a refill on your drink, and your check will probably take forever to come. \n\nThe reason that I continue to come here from time to time is because it is VERY cheap, near where I work, and it's always open. Not to mention my love of hot dogs of any variety. \n\nI typically order a chili cheese frank, which is usually mounding over with chili and cheese. The portion is delicious and generous. Beware, the chili frank comes with raw onions, which is a pretty common turn off for people for whatever reason. However, it's almost always thrown together in a way that somehow makes it even messier than it is by nature. Half the time the bun is ripped in half and you have to try to find a way to eat it and actually get chili into your mouth and not on the plate. The fries are mediocre. I'm not a fan of the ultra thin cut. I have to eat a million of them to feel satisfied. Though, I am addicted to their fry seasoning. I am an avid ketchup lover, and I forego my ketchup to enjoy the seasoning. \n\nThis particular visit I got a plain steak frank with ketchup on it because I wasn't very hungry. It was definitely good as far as hot dogs go (though, as a whole I'd say the general bar for hot dogs is set pretty low..). It's an all beef dog, which gives it a lot of flavor and somehow is more satisfying and filling than other hot dogs, which is purely a figment of my imagination. My friend got a pretty fancy looking burger, and our total came out to $8 and some change. Though the service is crappy (usually..I actually had a wonderful service experience today, which I've probably never been able to say about steak and shake before), the price really can't be beat.\n\nThis place is tolerable if you're looking for something quick and cheap, especially late. Other than that, I'd skip it.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

They're both average. The shakes are nothing to write home about. The burgers are average. Honestly, their burgers remind me alot of Wendy's.\n\nTheir fries are super thin and crispy, definitely tasty. They have chili which is actually VERY good. You can get it served Cincinnati style, which means piled on top of pasta with cheese and onions. Its delicious.\n\nThey have good hot dogs, as well. 100% beef and very flavorful. Once, we got their club sandwich and this thing was awesome! We were expecting the turkey to have that waxy, flabby texture of cheap turkey lunch meat. But it looked like it was fresh sliced of a real turkey breast!\nOther than that, we haven't tried a whole of their sandwiches, but their menu isn't huge, either.\n\nOne thing I like about this place is that they're pretty cheap. They have 8 burger\/fry combos that are just $4.00. They also always have coupons in the newspaper. They let you use any many coupons as you want. So the prices are pretty much comparable to regular fast food (or cheaper). Plus...kids eat free on weekends! As long as you order $.8.00 of foot, you get a free kids' meal. Drinks are not included but this is a nice perk. You can get apples or oranges for the kiddies, too, instead of fries.\n\nService is always fairly awful. The teenage girls they have working there obviously have never had waiting jobs before. You usually only see them once or twice throughout the whole meal. I have a hard time giving them a 15% tip because I know they make minimum wage and they really just take your order and ignore you for the rest of your meal. Once, the service was so awful, the manager just gave me the whole meal for free. I'm not expecting white glove service but a refilled water glass would be nice in  the middle of my meal.\n\nThis place is what it is. Its basically just fast food with pseudo-waitresses.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

We went with our salesman to test drive a Subaru Crosstrek, a Nissan Rogue, and the Hyundai Tucson. We never felt hurried and when we were done, we said we have to decide. We didn't talk price then and it was just a question which vehicle my wife felt the most comfortable in. We did our research as far as pricing and driver reviews and went with the Tucson. We went back the next Saturday and told them what options we wanted. He gave us the price and it was a couple of hundred dollars below what I expected them to come in at. We were satisfied at the price and we did the deal. They just had to order the color we wanted. It came in 2 days later. We got financing through them at a lower rate than my bank, PNC was giving me.

I called Bowser's service department, and after speaking with Matt, who was very cordial, they started working on my car as soon as I brought it in.  At first I was suspicious that their prices beat the local shops and common chains in the PIttsburgh area; surely the dealership had some hidden, non-itemized charges or astronomically expensive labor.  This was not the case. \n\nMy headlight requires removal of the wheel-well cover, a job that one third-party service provider quoted as $100 for an hour of labor alone.  Since I already had the bulb, Matt told me his Subaru mechanics could change it in 20 minutes for $10!  Here's what really astounds me, Bowser checked my brake pads, which had been squeaking, and recommended that I wait to buy new ones since my current pads were well within safe limits, all for free.  \n\nLater, Matt explained that I needed new tires and that he could get me out the door for $410.  Naturally, I didn't believe him because I've been conditioned to assume dealerships swindle their patrons.  I was wrong.  The tires he sold me are offered at Wal-Mart for only $19 less, a bargain considering $76 is less than a third the cost some service centers charge for attaching and aligning new tires.  Finally, when I requested new wiper blades, the service techs let me know that for less money I could simply replace the rubber instead of the entire blade itself.\n\nOverall, better quality, better prices, and better service than other dealerships and third-party mechanics.  Matt and his team truly exceeded every single expectation I had.  My whole life I have heard that if it's too good to be true, it is; Bowser Subaru's service department is the exception that proves the rule.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I stopped in and found a dresser in the clearance section for around $550. I asked if the coupon would apply and was given a yes. I was unsure if i really wanted the dresser so i left to think more about it. I returned the following day to reconsider the dresser and was being followed by a pushy salesman. I told him i was still considering the dresser, but it was a bit overpriced even with the 20% off coupon. Immediately, he started saying the coupon did not apply to clearance items. I told him I was told it would be honored by 2 other employees and he got very irritated and said, \" yeah, well it shouldn't apply, we are just helping you out, but its not actually valid like you think.\" -What a dick.\n\nKeep in mind this is the clearance section so these pieces have scratches\/ dents etc... I decided to offer a more fair price. I asked if they can reconsider the price. The salesman said, \"Its $550.\" \nI asked if the store would be willing to take \"500 plus the 20% off.\"\nThe response was a very rude\/ laughing at me \" Its 20% off $550!\" - complimented with a smug grin and eye roll. \nAnd in that single second- the sale was lost... but it gets better!\n\nI told the salesman I was no longer interested, but if i found anything else I would let him know. A couple minutes later, my family and i went to leave the clearance section. We walked past the salesman without saying anything to him.

No one said anything to him... so that was sure pleasant.   \n\nAbout 10 minutes later, i found a nicer dresser in the showroom area for about $800, my Mom went to get the salesman who was about 20 feet away. She approached him and another salesmen, both of which fully ignored her... probably writing us off as cheap and not worth his time. Finally, another saleswoman came to assist us. She was much more pleasant, however, she kept pushing to buy the whole bedroom set.

After reading glowing Yelp reviews of Banfield, I took my newly adopted puppy for her vaccinations. They told me I would save money on the Wellness Plan, and no one ever mentioned anything about a contract or having to pay money to cancel the contract - all they told me was that I would save money with it. So I signed up. (BTW no one ever provided me with a copy of any contract, and I don't recall ever signing one, so I don't believe there ever was a contract. They just like to use litigious wording to intimidate people)\n\nOur puppy was itching uncontrollably, so we asked the vet to address the issue. They shaved the pup's arm, for apparently no reason, and in the following days the itching situation exploded. We took the pup back in, asked the vet, \"Do you think it is food allergies?\" She (Dr. K. Thornton) responds, \"Yes it is, I'll prescribe you all this medicine and a special (expensive) food.\" SHE DID NOT RUN ONE SINGLE TEST TO CONFIRM IT WAS FOOD ALLERGIES.\n\nLong story short, we spent over a thousand dollars and went to Banfield 2-3 times a week for months because the vet misdiagnosed our dog! The whole time we were forced to watch our puppy suffer and itch herself raw, developing several bald spots all over her body. The whole time we had faith in the vet that the situation would improve. Well, it DIDN'T while we followed the vet's instructions, which included giving our dog a steroid (which ultimately proved useless since our dog NEVER HAD FOOD ALLERGIES).\n\nFinally, one night at around midnight our puppy looked near death, after being lethargic and not eating anything all day. We took her to an ER and spent another $300, but it saved her life. The ER vet gave us a topical antibiotic, and that is when we finally saw an improvement in her health.\n\nShe never had food allergies. SHE HAD DEMODECTIC MANGE AND WAS BEING EATEN ALIVE BY MITES! I had to diagnose the health problem myself after spending countless hours doing research. I've never been trained to be a vet, and yet I was able to do her job 100x better because I accurately diagnosed the problem. A different vet took skin scrapings to confirm that it was demodectic mange, NOT food allergies.\n\nAnd when we told the vet of her horrible mistake? Dr. K. Thornton didn't even apologize for the pain and suffering we went through due to HER negligence!\n\nAnd now, almost a year later, after I have discontinued using their services and told them that I wish to cancel and never agreed for a renewal of anything, they are STILL attempting to charge me for their \"Wellness plan\" each month!

I'm not to keen on Asian buffets as I mentioned in previous reviews, so it took some bribing to get me through the door. All I can say is, I'm so glad the bribe worked!\n\nThe last time I was here was years ago before it went under new ownership. It was a typical American buffet... cheap and did the trick. Yu's is that and more. Comparing it to the other location on 51 (I'm not sure, but they may have the same owner), EVERYTHING is better. From selection, food temperature and atmosphere. They have at least 8-10 stations to visit and the variety of food is amazing. I even found myself eating more of the Asian choices because everything was just that good. The ratio of American food to Asian food is pretty equal... From salads, to meat, to pasta and even sushi (it's enclosed in a case and is considered \"the Sushi Bar\") you will find something you like.  Service was good, too. Though, at a buffet you're not interacting too much with waitstaff. \n\nFor only about $13 a dinner, it was well worth the price and I will most definitely return.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The quality of the food is not that fantastic, as one usually expects at a buffet, but there is a lot of variety. This is not really a place for vegetarians to go to however.\n\nThe sushi situation needs improvement. There is a tiny bar where only one guy can make a few pieces at a time, so if the sushi line gets slammed, if will take you forever to get any. It would be better if they had a larger sushi bar with a few guys just working full time on the sushi putting out some plates of it.\n\nDidn't get any water refill though, so I was disappointed about the service. But overall, I would be inclined to check this place out again. The main attraction for me is the sushi however. You can also get sushi to go and the prices looked reasonable. \n\nThe exterior looks crappy, but the interior is quite nice. And they play traditional Chinese music. I love it when Chinese restaurants do this instead of playing the 'soft hits of the 90s.'\n\nFood Quality\/Taste = 3\nPortion Size Given Price = 5 Stars\nPrice = 4 Stars\nService = 2\nExperience with Staff = 3 Stars\nDecor = 4","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

However, since my mother failed to warn me, I felt compelled to warn others of this horrible experience. Sparing them the agony that I endured.\n\nPerhaps it sounds a bit much when describing an experience at a buffet. I mean, come on, this is a buffet. How good could be. How bad could it be? Better thank this.\n\nAnyone, who believes this is the best buffet on the face of the earth, hasn't been to the Grand China Buffet in Bridgeville. Not that the food at Bridgeville is especially amazing, but the Hibachi there is worth the price of the buffet. (A dollar cheaper per adult and they charge .60 per year on a kid.)\n\nTo me, any buffet with the hibachi grill, is worth it. If the hibachi grill is good. Unless you go to Fortune Star. The food is greasy and taste like a dirty grill. The man who cooked it, looked like he wanted to spit in my food, as if he was thinking, 'why do I have to cook for you.'. He was unpleasant and unkempt. \n\nThe most positive thing I can say about this place is the wait staff, they were pleasant enough. They didn't go out of their way but they still were pleasant. Unlike Hibachi man.\n\nThere wasn't much to choose from. Eight stations. One for ice cream, dessert, salad bar, cold food, appetizers, American food, hot food entrées and one for hibachi toppings. That's it. Nothing stood out. Absolutely nothing was outstanding.\n\nIt wasn't even average. It was below average. And it would've been semi tolerable had when I received the bill not have nearly fallen out of the booth. Even with 10% off, I wanted to die. Now, I am not cheap when it comes to buying a meal. I'll go to Bonefish. If the food is good. I will gladly pay for it. But this was not worth $12 an adult, seven dollars a child, and 2.50 a beverage. And... tea is not free! Back up, just for a six year old, seven year old with two sodas, $19.00! Are you kidding me? That much for just two kids. That was their portion. \n\nIt pained me, absolutely pained me to pay that bill. The kids barely ate. They gagged. \n\nTo top it off, I nearly broke a hip and fell when they failed to put signs up on the soaking wet freshly mopped floor.\n\nThe hostess did yell out a warning after I crossed the linoleum of death. Yeah, thanks, I wish you warned me BEFORE I ate.\n\nAll the way home with a knot in my stomach I kept thinking, \"all that money I just spent for me, my daughter and the two kids, I could've gone to many different places.\" \n\nGranted, $45 is not the end of the world, for less, I could've gotten a halfway decent meal at Eat and Park, For the same amount, I could have gone to Applebee's and got a cocktail, or saved $15 by taking a ride to the Bridgeville buffet and left satisfied.\n\nBeing a good daughter I decided to call my mother on the way home, warning her not to go there, and her response was, \"Oh, that place. Worst place on the face the earth don't go there.\"\n\"Ug, why didn't you tell me?\"\n\"I just did.\"\n\nIf you are thinking of cashing in that coupon and going to Fortune Star, do yourself a favor ... don't.

Please be aware that when you place an order online, it doesn't actually go anywhere until someone from the store calls you. I did not know this, but luckily I called the store on July 24 for an update on my order since it still showed \"in process.\" At this point, I was told that the order was never actually placed, but they would be happy to do that for me then. I was told the item would be in either the week of August 5 or August 12, which was fine. On July 27, I noticed that there were two charges to my credit card for the same order from two different DFW locations, Pleasant Hills and Wexford. I called the Pleasant Hills store to check into this, and I was told someone would call me back. No one called me back, but one of the charges was removed, so I guess they did resolve it but never let me know.  \n\nSince I still had not heard anything as of August 15, I called the Pleasant Hills store again. I spoke to someone who said he would check on my order and call me back in \"a couple minutes.\" As of August 19, I still had not received a call back, so I called again. Someone named Cory answered the phone this time and said he was helping another customer and asked me to call back in ten minutes. I called back, I was then told I needed to call the Wexford store. I just spoke to someone at the Wexford store and was told the order was placed on 8\/5 and would be in either the last week of August or first week of September. \n\nI understand that maybe 6 weeks is not THAT long to wait for furniture (is it?) but the complete misinformation I've been given, the lack of communication, and the fact that my order probably would have never been placed had I not called them to follow up in the first place is ridiculous.

When deciding between Subway and chick-fil-a, I decided I wanted something that was more local than a national chain. We decided to eat here because of the ratings plus i never turn down a good gyro.\n\nThe interior is pretty small til i seen extra seating in the back which i assume had booths but there was a wall blocking the view of the tables. we were seated but in chairs that kinda remind you your at the mall with the thin padding and jail bar backing. The menu was pretty nice with lots of choices of authentic greek dishes. I ordered grape leaves and my sis got the bubaganush which is eggplant hummus with pita bread. The grape leaves were tangy and the rice nice and soft, i really enjoyed the flavor. As for the hummus, it was GREAT!! the flavor of olive juice in the hummus made it so delicious with the soft pita bread. It wasn't too salty or bland but just right for my taste buds.\n\nFor our meal we ordered a 2 large gyros while my niece got chicken fingers and fries. Nothing special about the chicken fingers although the were cooked to order. The Gyro was HUGE!! Lots of meat i mean LOTS like 10 slices i think. When you add all the lettuce, tomatoes, onion and sauce, the pita could barely hold all the ingredients in. :D This made for a great looking gyro. The flavor was nothing too amazing but it was pretty good. It tasted like other gyros I've had but it just had more meat on it. The gyro only cost $6.19 which isn't bad for how amazingly huge it was. \n\nAs far as being satisfied it goes way beyond that. I couldn't even finish my gyro even tho the grape leaves and hummus may be to blame for that. Regardless it was a pretty good meal and I enjoyed everything that i ate. The service was decent. The waitress informed us of how everything was house made (excluding chicken) and we even got to thank the owners who were authentic greeks. They accept credit cards which is nice too because from first glance they appear to be cash only.

I have pretty high standards for my middle eastern cuisine, having worked in a lebanese restaurant for six years, so i am not the easiest to please when it comes to this genre of food... but i was pleasantly surprised.  \n\nThe hummis was pretty tasty-- obviously fresh and homemade, with a subtle tahini flavor and not overpowered by garlic (as it often is).  I also got fresh veggies to dip and they were crisp and delicious.  The grape leaves are awesome because they come vegetarian, and you can get 6 of them for only $3.50 (amazing!).  The only so-so item i got was the spinach pie, and i only thought this because it's too bready for me... it has layers and layers and layers of filo dough and not enough taste to the feta and spinach filling.  Oh and strangely, they do not have tabouli or falafel on the menu.\n\nOverall, though, I will absolutely go here again.  It's so nice to have a good ethnic restaurant in this area that tends to be swallowed up by applebee's galore.

We tend to order to share while honoring each others specific tastes.   What a wonderful experience!  I believe it exceeded our expectations and we fully intend to return.\n\nAfter careful consideration (by me-it could possibly be my last meal- so be very diligent!), we started with the Special Greek Platter.  It included grape leaves, which we all enjoyed, fried meatballs (only two of us ate these - they are awesome), Spanakopita (delicious),feta, olives, tomatoes, and hummus (maybe the best I have tasted!) This is a great choice for 2-4 people to have a sample of many wonderful tastes or for one to have a very nice personal feast.\n\nWe shared two large salads, the Bifteki - greek salad (essentially) with 2 greek burgers and the Half & Half - again greek salad with gyro meat and chicken.  Our server was happy to provide an additional dish and offered more if we required them - nice touch!  Both salads were served with their greek dressing and cucumber sauce. I am a sauce and dressing person and tend to order \"extra\" - what was provided was quite sufficient for our party.  I really liked all of the meats as well as the salad itself.  For me the thinly sliced gyro meat was the star, then the chicken and lastly the greek burger.  The others in the group would have rated it differently, one with burger at the top, then chicken(she thought it a bit over cooked), then gyro meat (but she doesn't care for it at all and still said it was good) and the other gyro, burger, chicken.  Nobody was unhappy!!\n\nThe restaurant  was quite clean and comfortable for a very casual eatery.  The service was very considerate and attentive without being overbearing. The entire staff was very friendly and welcoming.\n\nAll-in-all an extremely pleasant experience!!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

She ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY hates gyros.  But she loves these (and as a matter of fact is craving them something fierce as I type this).  I could probably end my review here, but let me elaborate further.\n\nDarren W. is absolutely right -- eating one of these gyros is a truly Herculean effort.  I can just barely finish one, and I'm guaranteed to not be hungry for more or less the rest of the day.  And what a gyro it is!  Gigantic, toasty pita.  Wonderfully seasoned lamb, and tons of it.  Tzatziki sauce that is one part cool cucumber and two parts AMBROSIA OF THE GODS.  Crisp lettuce, juicy tomato, flavorful onion.  All wrapped up in a large foil package that contains all the wonders of modern compression technology therein, because the package itself is deceptively SMALL for what lies within.\n\nDarren also jokingly claims that if you give the Minotaur this gyro, he'll be your friend.  I'm in absolute agreement, except for one detail.  The story usually ends with the Minotaur having the gyro for lunch, right?  At Gali's, the gyro is so huge and powerful that THE GYRO HAS THE MINOTAUR FOR LUNCH, not the other way around.\n\nHighly, highly, recommended.\n\nEAT GYRO OR DIE!","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The meat was juicy, but somewhat crispy from roasting on whatever you call that rotating gyro stick, the cucumber sauce was creamy but not overdone, and the greek salad dressing was some of the best I've ever had. Spend the extra $1.00 and add feta to that salad for a special treat (it's super fresh and an nice change from the fat free Sam's Club feta I'm use to!).\n\nWe also ordered 6 grape leaves, which were served hot and added on the homemade hummus with warm pita bread. By the time it was all said and done, the wife and I walked out for less that $30 and each had a  gyro, salad, iced teas, hummus & grape leaves.

It's my favorite tzatziki around...creamy, fresh, and just the right amount of spices.  Another appetizer that I really enjoy is the grape leaves.  They have a great texture and the rice filling is flavorful and vegetarian.\n\nThe gyros here are also excellent and can be ordered with lamb, beef, chicken, pork, or vegetables.  Plenty of meat and toppings, with just the right amount of tzatziki sauce.  I sometimes go for the Chicken Plate, which is sort of like a deconstructed gyro...it comes with grilled chicken, sliced tomato and cucumber, feta cheese, greek olives, pita, and a side of tzatziki, all arranged on a plate. Sometimes the chicken is a bit greasy, but it is nonetheless delicious.  \n\nIf you find yourself in the South Hills area, this place is a must-try.

They took what could have been my worst restaurant experience, and turned it around into something amazing.\n\nI brought my father in in the early afternoon. He has been having severe back problems as of late, but wanted to get out and grab wings together. Upon entering, the hostess took us to our table. My dad made it about half way, and his back fully gave out. He couldn't move, and was stuck in pain in the hallway outside of the bathroom.\n\nThe hostess and server jumped into action. They immediately got him a chair to sit in right there, while I grabbed him a pain pill and his walker. They then gave him some water, and proceeded to chat with us for the next 15 minutes or so.\n\nTo put this in perspective, we were right smack in the middle of the main walkway to the tables, taking up over half the space. The staff did not see this as inconvenient, however. Their main concern was my dad's well being.\n\nOnce he was up to it, they helped walk him out of the building. It was slow going, and he had to stop and sit about four times along the way. The staff and I basically carried him. They helped him to my car, held the doors, and everything.\n\nDuring the whole ordeal, we took an order for a couple of buckets of wings to go. The hostess insisted that they would handle the charge, and just wanted to see my dad back again, all healed up.\n\nThe whole ordeal was totally selfless on the part of Quaker Steak and their staff. I will not only be going back again, but recommending others.\n\nOh, and the wings were delicious.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":4,"type":"review"}

The flavor variety is impressive and every once in awhile they cycle in some new flavors. Not too bad given they don't HAVE to do that!\n\nSo specifically for this location, I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars because our server brought out the wrong flavor several times. She also brought out the wings literally in like 30 seconds..... which lets me know that they weren't made for our order, they were siting around waiting to be served. I mean, I ate them anyway because hey, basically all the flavors taste good, but I let her know that it is strange to get several orders that aren't what we requested.\n\nAnyway, the wings here definitely are good. And if you're in the area it's not a bad choice. I live in Pittsburgh and am equidistant from the Robinson location which seems to have fresher preparation. I don't hold location against this place since it serves the folks in the region.

But I recently went here when it wasn't wing night and got wings and they were just as dry and sticky.  \n\nYesterday I went here with the whole family for dinner after a Pirates game and thought I'd try something other than wings. I got the cheesesteak...and it was not good. The meat was extremely dry and it reminded me of having cheesesteaks at my high school cafeteria. I also split some onion rings with the rest of the table...and at least those were very good. \n\nDespite my disappointment in the food, I do have to say the service was really good yesterday. I was with my finace's family, which included 11 adults and 6 children. The 6 children were a little more hyped up than usual. We had one server and she did a fantastic job taking care of our table. She got all of our orders correct and was continually filling up our drinks.

A forgotten $25 gift card prompted Kay and I to journey to the OG that started the love affair over a decade ago when my sister and her then beau wanted to reward my unemployed ass for helping them move. \n\nHow they actually prepare their food, I couldn't tell you. I am not privy to what goes on in their kitchens, but one taste of their tender, cornmeal-coated calamari (their best appetizer) dipped in that ranchy parmesan-peppercorn sauce, and I no longer care. When they bring out the chilled salad chock-full of tomatoes, greens, onions, and croutons that is skillfully tossed with that exceedingly delicious vinaigrette vs. Caesar dressing, my bias against chains is diffused, and I come to realize that Marilyn Hagerty's humble, Plain-English words are truth --that she is not to be ridiculed. \n\nBraised Beef & Tortelloni was something I had yet to try, and when it came to our table, my gastronomic heart beat loudly for the short ribs fell apart with minimal chewing as did the portobello mushrooms, the very fungi that rival sirloin in sheer heartiness. The al dente pasta, filled with asiago, wallowed euphorically in a severely savory basil-marsala sauce. Some sour cream could have turned this into a dandy Beef Stroganoff. \n\nA slightly freezer-burnt (or not entirely thawed?) Tiramisu let me down a little, but its creaminess and coffee-laden flavors couldn't be quelled by some ice-flakes. \n\nIf those preparing OG's dishes are not really cooking, then they are brilliant illusionists, fooling the public (or at least me) into thinking they truly wield culinary magic...or microwaves?

I came in for lunch in November and asked for Coke Zero with no ice and a glass of wine from a fresh bottle. IMMEDIATELY the server, also the lady who was acting as bartender, said they only keep the opened bottles for x amount of time, as though SHE GETS TO DECIDE how fresh I prefer my wine. That was my very first red flag that this server was an argumentative know-it-all who did things HER way and was right about everything, leading to the worst experience in dining that I've had in probably years, and the worst at any Olive Garden ever. \n\nSo I asked for fresh wine and Coke Zero with no ice. I gave the server a $10 bill as a good-faith gesture of getting part of her gratuity up front by showing I am not some rude ass who stiffs servers with $1 gratuities. She came back with the \"fresh\" wine and my Coke Zero and I started to say, \"Oops, I guess I got you flustered\" -- well, she cut me off right there. Great listener, huh? I was going to say the talk about fresh wine musta made her forget that I ordered no ice in the Coke Zero. She broke into my sentence saying, \"OH, YOU CAN'T FLUSTER ME. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS WAY TOO LONG.\" So then I finished, as she set down my Coke Zero with 200 ice cubes in it. \"Well, I was going to say you musta been a bit flustered because you brought all that ice out.\" At that point, I was the jerk. She took the glass and brought it back sans ice. OK. Then I ordered a \"trio\" (some plate with three items) and she asked if I wanted soup or salad. I said, \"WELL, GEEZ, why not do it as an unlimited soup and salad? You still do that, right?\" She said yes, so I said to go ahead with that.\n\nSo the soup and salad comes.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later, she swings by and asks if everything was OK. I said yes, except for the trio not arriving. She looked at me with a hostile air this time. \"You didn't order that,\" she said. \"You ordered unlimited soup and salad.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"I ordered the trio, and the unlimited soup or salad on top of that.\" Obviously her first impression of being a poor listener had carried through to the meal ordering. At this point, she didn't say, \"Oh, no! I'm sorry!\" or \"Let me fix that\" or \"Whoops\" or \"My fault! I'll put it in right now!\" Instead, she scowled, turned her back and walked off with no words at all.\n\nNext a manager came over and asked what was going on and confirmed the trio had been ordered. I said it seemed odd that he was suddenly at the table handling the ordering as if I had done something WRONG. No, he said, he was \"Just helping out.\"\n\nSo the trio came. That was fine. Tasty, even. And maybe 5 or 15 minutes later he brought the check. I put a card in it. Guess what. The check not only didn't comp anything for the rude service and errors, it ADDED extra soup on to the tune of about $5. I waited to bring this up to the manager and he didn't return for THIRTY MINUTES. At that point I was a little steamed. The server had disappeared WITH MY $10 UP-FRONT TIP, as though I were an ASS, he had taken over, and denied anything was wrong, and THEN left me sitting for half an hour waiting to pay. So I explained myself a little more frankly. \"Your server didn't get the order right and walked off like I was a jerk, you take over, and you NOT only don't comp anything, you charge me for MORE than I ordered, then leave me hanging for 30 minutes.\"\n\nHis answer? He didn't know I wanted to pay. I ordered the UNLIMITED soup and salad, he said -- that meant I could have wanted to sit there indefinitely. \n\nReally? That is a lie, and an insincere response at best. WHAT'S MORE: He never offered to BRING any more soup or salad to begin with.\n\nWell, that time, he took the excess soup off the bill and I think the trio. Fine. I still waited probably 15 minutes to have the check processed.\n\nBottom line? Your server here is BETTER THAN YOU, and you'd better worship at her temple. And if you don't, she'll KICK YOU OUT of it and have some insincere liar kick you around further. I STILL left a few dollars in the check presenter. ON TOP of the $10 she made off with.\n\nDO NOT GO.\n\nPeople like these should be ashamed of themselves.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

You actually order your own appetizers without any waitress interaction.  Wow, isn't THAT what you've always wanted?  Let's go out to a restaurant and listen to loud talkers & screaming babies while we quietly order our own food...  Nope, I'm NOT a fan.  \n\nWe had been craving pasta for some time now so when my wife suggested the OG last night, I said, Let's GO!  We were seated promptly as they weren't very busy but unlike other restaurants where they try to seat you NOT on top of other diners, here they led us, or as it actually looked, they HERDED US, into the back corner of the restaurant.  The front half was pretty deserted, but they wanted us to sit right up next to a table of 'fillers'.  You know the type- the people that sit down, adjust the table to their preference, spread their chairs out till their short dinosaur arms can barely reach the table, but so that their belly actually fits in between the table & their spine, completely inconsiderate of other diners...  Yea- the hostess tried to seat us butted right up against their table.  Nope, I don't think so.  We suggested another table, leaving that one as a buffer zone.  \n\nHere a friendly waitress came over and made us feel very welcome.  She introduced us to 'table-tron' which I declined, and asked if she would mind it all that much taking our order herself.  She politely accepted but still had to enter our appetizer order into table-tron.  Then I told her we were even ready to order our entrees, which she said don't get entered into table-tron but get written down and hand delivered to the kitchen.  Let me jump ahead, if I may...  Why is it that restaurants NEVER ask you if you are ready for your entrees?  They deliver the App then mid-bite race back to the kitchen to pick up your entrees...  Our App was a combo calamari (which was DELICIOUS), crab stuffed shrooms and fried zucchini.  The shrooms were still bubbling from the broiler when delivered and the zucchini were as hot as molten lava.  We had just enough time to take a couple bites of calamari and I burned my tongue off on a zucchini when the waitress delivered the entrees.  Wow, that was a good thing because (sarcasm alert) I CERTAINLY didn't want to actually eat the App right there in the store.  \n\nOn to the Entrees...  Kim ordered the create your own pasta and added sausage links & meatballs, yes, I laughed because I knew she would be full even before the entrée arrived.  Hers came out looking like the angel hair which she specially ordered had been in the water SO long it was swelled to the size of regular spaghetti... but it was DRY.  Of course it had the sauce & sausage & meatballs on it but do they keep their pasta under a heatlamp drying out till someone orders it, then they dump it on & send it out?  The sausage tasted decent but the meatballs were straight from Sysco.  Why order them out when they taste exactly the same if you cook them at home?  \nI order the tour of Italy.  Penne with some kind of orange sauce, chicken with moz & provo cheese and lasagna.  The chicken was some sort of combination between grilled breast and chix patty.  It was about as big as a fist but perfectly thin, about a half inch thick.  Do they slice it on a deli meat slicer?  Looks like it.  The lasagna was not what I was expecting.  Stouffers lasagna comes out of the pan looking better than this stuff.  It almost looked like they took a tablespoon of ricotta and plated it, layed a 4\" piece of noodle over it, added a little sauce & repeated one more time.  This display of non-Italian cooking would send every single REAL Italian into cardiac arrest.  Even my mother who has absolutely no Italian in her blood-line makes a Rolls Royce compared to this Hugo.  \n\nThe salad is the only reason I would return to this location, as the breadsticks are again disappointing.  They taste like Sysco as well, frozen not fresh, dense & not light & airy, warmed in an oven.  \n\nAdd the OG to the list of places not to go back to.  I'd rather spend the 3 hours in the kitchen with my wife making us exactly what we want instead of being disappointed with this 'Corporate Imitation Italian' ever again...","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

I can recall seeing their commercials on local TV for years and wanting very much to try them, if for no other reason than that they were a seafood restaurant that wasn't Red Lobster. Although, after about 5 mediocre-to-bad visits over the course of as many years prior to my Yelp tenure, I finally gave up on them. The reviews I read on Yelp in the years since my last experience with Baltimore House only affirmed my boycott. \n\nThat was until Kay had a hankering for mussels, again. Why not give BH another chance? \n\nAnd BH does them pretty well if our meal was any proof. The mussels were as tender, juicy, and buttery as they should be with some chopped garlic added to pump up the flavor quotient. \n\nI couldn't decide on what to order for myself, so I went with their Seafood Norfolk, which features everything I pine for when I errr...sea-dine; lobster, scallops, crabmeat, and shrimp were all unimaginatively thrown together and sauteed in a butter sauce. \n\nWas it good? Well, yeah. To be truthful, I was starving, and the aforementioned ingredients are difficult to botch. However, combine that with a lifeless baked potato, burnt croutons, and a decent but obviously pre-fabricated Oreo mousse dessert, and I cannot give BH anything more or less than a 3. \n\nKay ordered the extravagant Admiral's Seafood Platter, a smorgasbord that includes a lobster tail, scallops, shrimp, oyster shells stuffed with their Crabmeat Imperial, and filet mignon, all prepared yet again with BH's magic component, butter. She did let me taste the filet mignon, and through that morsel, I learned in splendid fashion that medium-rare is always the way to go when ordering steak. This was ideally cooked beef.  \n\nOur server did a fine job and was a nice kid, so I have no gripes on that end.\n\nThe interiors of The Baltimore House are eccentric and vast. You never know which room you'll be seated in. There's the room with the kitschy pirate statues, a few others I cannot recall, and then the faux nightclub. \n\nGuess where they put us. \n\nMy back was turned for the duration of our meal, but based on the strident, pounding 80's dance music, multicolored lights, and odd barks and hoots that assailed my senses, I thought a wild party was afoot somewhere in the house. \n\nWhen I turned around, I only saw a handful of middle-aged suburbanites at the bar. \n\nBefore we left, our waiter revealed that there were some \"serious\" drink specials that night, particularly on Jager bombs. \n\nCall the babysitter. Ask her to stay a little later. Woo. Hoo. \n\nThe Baltimore House is an oddity that fails to be extraordinarily good but is in no way egregiously bad. If they were a little less pricey, I'd recommend them as a go-to for those times when one is desperate for seafood, but being that they're in the \"Spendy\" range, I'd advise area diners to stay away like most of the other reviewers on Yelp have. \n\nP.S. BH also houses a restaurant-within-a-restaurant called Kazoku that specializes in Japanese fare, including teppanyaki and sushi, but they were closed when we were there Friday evening. \n\nP.P.S. I should have taken a picture of the opulently wacky enclosed waterfall display outside. Clark Griswald would be impressed.","useful":12,"funny":9,"cool":7,"type":"review"}

Because my husband and I used to enjoy the Baltimore House--but after our last meal there, we won't be back for a while.\n\nThe Baltimore House is one of the few places left in the Greater Pittsburgh area that serves stuffed flounder, which my husband loves.  The first three times he had it, he said it was perfect.  Heck, kitschy décor and oddball waitresses aside, for years we had great food every time, until our last visit.  The appetizer was burned.  Okay, so we'll say something, but our dinners are always great.  We would have said something, if given the chance!  There weren't that many people in the restaurant, but one would have thought they were packed to the gills; we didn't see our waitress for another 20 minutes, when she brought our entrees, then rushed off to the kitchen again.  Then we started eating our dinners, which both tasted like they had been liberally doused with salt.  Practically inedible.  Then a family of about 15 people came in, and the waitress busied herself with them during the rest of our visit.  We had trouble just getting the bill, let alone having a chance to complain.  We decided to pay it, leave, and stay away from Baltimore House for a bit.\n\nWe may go back in a few months to see if things have changed, because the food used to be really great.

There was some sort of benefit concert taking place so it was unclear where to enter.  Once we finally navigated that we were asked to sit in smoking or non-smoking.  We chose non, but let's just say that didn't stop the smoke from bellowing over to our table.  In fact, my hair and clothes reeked from the hour I sat there. \n\nI can count on one hand the number of times I've sent a meal back to the kitchen and this recent experience at the Baltimore House can be counted in that category.  We both chose the Alaskan crab legs and both immediately returned them.  The little to no crab meat in the case was cold and rubbery.  The waitress was nice though and immediately grabbed them and asked if we wanted something else.  I got the crab cakes, which were 'meh' and my s-i-l just ordered mozzarella sticks that were also inedible.  So we didn't insult or further upset our waitress she wrapped them up and hid them so it looked like she ate them.  \n\nService was spotty but our waitress was nice.  Another employee at one point walked by our tables and yelled out the F-word.  The 'bouncer' at the door near the ground floor entrance said he was only there for the event and had no idea if\/when you could be seated.  \n\nDecor is very bizarre and includes a non-working Jacuzzi under the steps.  There appears to be a nautical\/pirate theme but I also saw some other weird statues, such as a dog.  I wouldn't mind all that if the food wasn't so terrible.

If I hadn't been there with my aunt, I'd have given our waitress a good smack!  \n\nBut anyway, the fish I had was actually pretty good so there's at least one person there who knows what he's doing.  I had stuffed flounder which was served in a very hot pewter pan.  There were three pieces wrapped around some seafood stuffing.  And it was pretty good and I ate it all!  The side dishes were just so-so.  I think I had steamed veggies and something else.\n\nAll in all, it was passable but no better.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Shame on me.    It took over 10 minutes to get greeted and drinks ordered which took another 10 to arrive.   Our salad came 15 minutes after she brought the drinks and bread - the entrees took over an hour, and she forgot my Lobster Bisque (which she brought only after I asked about it - had one piece of lobster in it but mostly broth and potatoes).     My husband got the wrong salad and ranch dressing when he asked twice for Italian dressing.   The fish was ok, but not as described in the menu.  She gave my sides to him and his to me - thank God we're married and can share plates.\n   She gave him mashed potatoes when he ordered a baked potato.   Then when we pointed that out, she said \"oh let me go get you one\" but then came back over 10 minutes later saying that the cook told her they were out of baked potatoes and he substituted the mashed (no one asked us!)   She asked if he wanted something different and he said 'No thanks i'll eat these\" but when I asked him why he didn't get a vegetable or fries he just looked at me and said \"Why so she can bring me squid as a substitute?\"    The mashed sweet potatoes taste like Gerber baby food potatoes (not kidding - I'd avoid these altogether).\n  Our waitress had a very stoic  \"I could care less\" attitude while waiting on us and everything took way too long to arrive.   No manager checked on us and the waitress never checked on us to see if our food was ok.  The bathroom door does not close nor lock and the staff were seen complaining (using the F-bomb) right by customers at the bar - about their hours and wanting to go home and about not liking the long shift they were working.     You can tell the place is not managed properly (I used to work in food service years ago so I know) and the staff really don't like being there.     \nI would not return, not even with a coupon.

My husband's lobster bisque was a salty, gloppy mess which may have had some lobster flavoring added to it somewhere in there, along with the puzzling presence of potatoes. Steamed clams were ok..not great but not terrible...were overcooked though. Prime rib was inedible. Leathery, thin, super-fatty, cold, and other than the taste of old beef tallow, had no flavor...like it had been sitting in a warmer for the last four or five days. I ate a few bites because I was starving and we were still an hour and a half away from home, but it was so vile that I just left three-quarters of it on the plate. Didn't bother sending it back because by then, it was evident that any replacement would have been no better. My husband got an abomination of a broiled seafood medley that was rubbery and tasted of nothing but oily melted margarine and garlic powder. \n\nBeen to many a restaurant in my 50 years, and usually am at least moderately satisfied. This place, however, was among the worst I have ever had the misfortune to experience. It looks like it used to be a good place, maybe like 25 years ago, and perhaps some family member inherited it a while back who know little of decent food and restaurant management, and is now just barely hanging on.

There were maybe 6 other patrons in the establishment. Sushi chef was a no-show and they were out of items we wanted to order (it took them 2 hours to realize they had no gyoza!) What kills me here is that the place was NOT busy at all. Not once did the waiter offer to refill our water. I wish they'd had just said they couldn't serve us.\n\nIn detail: (I'd been here before for sushi and the only issue before was waiting to be seated...which took 10-15 minutes) We (a party of 4) arrived at 4:30 for the 1\/2 off sushi and we waited a while to be seated. We were only seated when we walked into the bar portion and told someone we were there. The waiter alerted us that the sushi chef was late and that there might be a little bit of a wait and that they'd extend the 1\/2 off sushi discount for us as a result. We figured maybe they were stuck in traffic or something, it happens, but they'd eventually show up soon. We sat around for a while waiting to order some drinks and appetizers. The frozen drinks couldn't be done because their machine wasn't working. They had no edamame at all. We ordered tuna tar-tar, spicy shrimp, gyoza, miso soup, 8 sushi rolls and our drinks. I believe it was about 5-5:15pm (30 to 45 hour later) before the miso soup came out. The tuna tar-tar and spicy shrimp appetizer came out about 15 minutes later. We asked about the gyoza and the waiter said that there had been an issue since the gyoza wasn't on the menu properly (or something similar...which made no sense to us) and that he'd get the order put in again. I understand that since the sushi chef hadn't shown up yet, that some things couldn't be made yet ...but we finally started receiving the sushi rolls at around 6:15pm (almost 2 hours from the time we arrived\/ordered). We got the sushi rolls NOT because the sushi chef arrived, but because 2 guys were making it themselves (we didn't realize this until we were paying our bills, the sushi chef was a no-show all night). The guys did a decent job at making the sushi, so I'm sure they had some training. They brought everyone's order out plopped on plates at random and the waiter didn't know which roll was which and he had to ask the guys who made the sushi about what was what...and they didn't seem to even quite know. The sushi rolls were good, but not quite what was described on the menu. Some had a type of fish or vegetable substituted for something else or just mixed around. We're frustrated and at this point not going to argue about what the sushi is supposed to be. We want to eat and leave. At 6:30 we finally had our last sushi roll delivered to the table. We asked about the gyoza again and the waiter came back and said they had none. 2 hours...and they finally figured out that they had NONE. This was kind of the last straw with the place. Due to the wait and everything, the waiter said the manager was willing to give us all each 1 drink free. Most of us didn't order another and opted to have our current one free. When we got our checks, the drinks hadn't been removed and the waiter had to go back and adjust the check which took a while. We finally got out of there around 7:15. Not all of this was the sushi chef's fault for not showing, not all was the waiter's fault...Everything just had something wrong or missing from the service, to the food, to the missing food. We won't be going back. I've never had to wait almost 3 hours or had as many issues as we did. Big shame because we live so close to Kazoku.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

When we finally decided to stop in, we were quite surprised to find what is a very vast and extravagant interior. Sure, there's still some tacky inside, but you could spend hours just walking through exploring the curious objects like it was some strange museum. \n\nThe prices for both the fish and the alcohol are extremely reasonable; much lower than you'll find for comparable meals in the area. The fish also met with my father's very exacting standards (he is never one to miss when someone uses \"K\"rab meat, \"nearly fresh\" fish, or just the wrong type of fish altogether). \n\nThe interior space, prices, and location near Jefferson Memorial Park also made this the perfect place when we needed a restaurant for a post-funeral lunch. Their menu options were very traditional and perfect for our needs, and as a group I believe we finished every last item served on the buffet. With the reasonable drink prices, it was also very easy to make it a cash bar without anyone feeling put out. \n\nAt this point we've eaten there maybe a half dozen times - any time my family comes to town we usually take a trip over. The individual experiences have been a bit of a mixed bag, with the worst being a Friday night we went and were seated upstairs near a band that was warming up the entire meal. I and my mother enjoyed the crab cakes, not the ambiance, though my father was very disappointed with his seafood pasta meal as being almost devoid of fish and overly sauced. The waitresses have also been kindof mixed, some being very nice while others have been downright weird.\n\nOur best meals there have generally been during the week, or for lunch, where they seat us downstairs off the bar area. I will probably avoid dinner hour on the weekends going forward, since it's those times that didn't go as well.\n\nDespite a couple of mediocre experiences, I still like this place and have never personally had a bad meal food-wise. It's one of the few non-chain restaurants in the Century III area, and honestly the interior just fascinates me every time.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Decent food, HORRIBLE service!!!\n\nWe arrived at 5:20pm and actually thought the place was closed at first, not a soul was there.  A waitress told us to \"sit anywhere\"  and brought us drinks and menus and then 20 minutes later had us move from our empty table to another empty table where we sat, ignored for another 25 minutes.  We think they were waiting to try to \"fill up\" the table, but no one came out and said anything to us like \"We'd like to wait xx long to see if anyone else comes.\"  So, just after 6 another couple came in and was seated with us.  After they decided and placed their order, the hibachi chef confirmed our order and said that he'd \"See about starting soon\".  Our soup arrived a full hour after we'd first sat down.\n\nThe soup was good, the salad was veggies that had clearly been in the fridge cut up too long (dried out carrots, wilted greens) swimming in their dressing. No forks were provided, so everyone ate salad with fingers\/chopsticks.  Finally when the chef started cooking, he broke one of the eggs so it was unusable, and didn't add another, making 3 servings of fried rice with just one egg. I was supposed to have steamed rice, but the waitress brought the me sushi rice, then took it back and brought back the steamed rice.  \n\nThe chef over cooked our rare beef, his knife was clearly not sharp enough because he had to really work to get through the veggies and our meat, we discovered, was not sliced through, and we had large chunks of meat, too big for bite-sized.\n\nWe waiting more than 15 minutes more after we were done for our check. They had cleared our plates so knew that we were done.  I had to go find a manager to get our checks and then there was a problem because they had apparently put it in all as one.  We had a PG deal coupon and the waitress repeatedly asked us what it was and where we got it.  After I complained to the manager, she gave us 1\/2 off one of our meals, making it just over $40 for the entire bill, so thank goodness we had the PG Deal because that was definitely way too much for the okay food and horrible, horrible service.

I didn't want to taste test it for myself, so I'll take my friends' word for it that it tasted as terrible as it looked.  One of the unlucky receivers of steak called over a manager.

As soon as she saw us, she told us we'd have to wait at least 15 minutes. We sat down at the bar. And waited. Finally the sushi chef offered to get us some beers. We had to wait for those, too. Once we got the beers, mine was all funky. It had gotten warm and had been put back in the cooler. Gross.\n\nWe ended up waiting about 20 minutes to be seated. They sat us down underneath the stage while a band was warming up. After some waiting, the server brought us some cold bread and we asked if we could go sit in the corner away from the band. She obliged.\n\nWe waited. Finally we got our drinks. After we finished them, we had to actually go to the bar and ask for refills because the server was just nowhere to be found. Maybe she was busy in the back trying to do her sidework or something...I don't know. She only had four tables, I don't know why she was missing half the night.\n\nThe food was good. Their prices have gone up since we had been there. They have this three item combo where you pick like a steak, some seafood, some chicken, etc...and you get mashed potatoes and veggies. It used to be $19, now its $24. We got the lobster tail, the prime rib and coconut shrimp. It was all good. We also got this seafood platter that had shrimp scampi, beer batter cod, scallops and a baked potato for like $17. Everything was good. But the fact that we just had to wait and wait and wait made it all kind of crappy.\n\nI guess they recently added some teppenyaki (or Hibachi as you yinzers like to call is) tables and stuff. They have sushi also but the sushi chef was making the sushi in the bar area. We sat and watched him make about six rolls and he didn't wash his hands once. \n\nThe only real consolation was that she only charged us for one vodka soda and I had about five. Plus the two beers and ice tea.\n\nOh...and the band was awful. They were called Run 4 Cover and....you bet we did as soon as we could get out of there.","useful":4,"funny":5,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

When we saw the Baltimore House while driving, it looked like the perfect spot, so we excitedly parked and went in. When you walk in you are greeted with a mostly empty fish cooler, one can only assume that at the height of this establishment's popularity the cooler was filled with fresh fish, but now sat sadly barren. I say it was mostly empty because it still held a few pieces of fake greenery with plastic fish on top, as a decoration that I appreciated. The lighting was a combination of bright neon and nothing else, which created an ambiance very similar to a strip club, making the massive but unfortunately mostly empty dining room feel like an undiscovered cavern adorned with various seafaring-related decorations. We were led through the cavern to a separate dining room that was a striking departure from the first. It was reminiscent of your grandparents house, but again, filled with sea-related decorations. I was hoping to get a simple salmon filet, so you would think I wouldn't have a problem with that at a seafood restaurant, but turns out there is no salmon at all at this seafood restaurant. Before we realized this, we ordered two iced teas that we didn't even take the straw wrappers off of, but we were still charged for the drinks when we told the waitress that we were leaving, $5 for two unsweetened iced teas. This place may have been the bees knees 15 years ago, but these days it's a hollow shell of what I assume it used to be.\n\nEDIT: Bumped up to two stars from one because they have a kick-ass Bruce Lee statue outside","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Sequestered in the corner of a half-abandoned shopping center off of Curry Hollow Road in a part of Pittsburgh all too many residents pretend doesn't exist squats yet another All-American Diner. Pink, black, and silver accentuate the interiors from ceiling to floor, from stool to counter. Framed pictures of Classical Hollywood luminaries such as Lucille Ball, Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, and Frank Sinatra ornament the flamingo walls along with stenciled-on quotes from famous people, agreeably reminding me of Bridgewater's Mezza Luna Cafe. On a chalkboard one can view the entire menu. \n\nIn overall spirit, my particular brunch at Our Little Secret strongly parallels the one had just 24 hours ago at Waffles INCaffeinated, and that includes uncostly breakfast fare of the uppermost merit. Gracing our paper-cloaked table were escutcheon-shaped plates that held the following dishes: Baltimore Style Eggs Benedict, Peanut Butter & Banana Crepes, and Kay's Chop Special which came with her choice of french toast. \n\nDeja vu? Ya think?\n\nThere were differences, however. My Baltimore Style Eggs Benedict came with full-on crabcakes instead of morsels of crab and the tops of each were lightly scorched for presentation. I told our waiter that these crabcakes were better than those served by Baltimore House, a nearby seafood specialty restaurant, and I wasn't just blowin' smoke -- these contained loads of REAL, fibrous crabmeat (are ya readin', Grant Bar?), and showed that great crabcakes don't necessarily have to be comprised of jumbo lump to be worthy (I'm thinking these were either made with special or backfin, both of which are just fine as far as my stomach goes). The outside was crackling, the inside was smooth, rich blessedness, the filler was minimal, and the two of them were had with the usual Eggs Benedict components for just under $11. And while we're walking down this street, let's talk about that hollandaise sauce. Goddamn, I was beginning to think that I'd never find an area restaurant that did one well. As much as I liked 'em, even Original Pancake House's hollandaise failed to tempt me (mom's is still best). Who knew I'd have eggs benedict two days in a row and that both would be glazed with a stunning mutha of a mother sauce? Citrusy, lardy, and dissolute, at first I scraped some of the xanthous gravy onto my fork and knife, savoring the sauce alone, dangerously coming close to ignoring (and it would have been tragic for these beauts to get cold) each gracefully poached egg, both of them bloated with ichorous yolk so sweltry, one wonders how it didn't solidify. Some agile cookery is going on in this kitchen. \n\nProperly saving them for dessert (sez me), the pair of Peanut Butter & Banana Crepes caused me to crave ice cold milk (or more Sierra Mist) with their hard palate-clinging properties and their briny, nectarous, carbohydratic nature. Unlike Waffles INC. where the peanut butter is melded with whipped cream (a chiffon) to keep it from being too rich (as WINC's co-owner Josh confessed to me), OLS doesn't wuss out (not that I didn't love WINC's chiffon). So yes, you'll be drinking lots of liquid with it, but you'll love it. Furthering the richness were the omelete-ish, custardesque, quivering, canary crepes themselves that were sifted with powdered sugar and swollen with the titular contents. \"Ooof!\" I declared after finishing the last one. Who said crepes were dainty, now? \n\nSplintery taters littered our plates like hay that had spilled from the back of a truck, and they were as oily, crunchy, and starchy as the best hash house shredded tubers tend to be. \n\nWe arrived around 11:30AM (an hour before closing), and I was initially relieved that we had no trouble finding a booth to sit in, but as I overheard the co-owner complain during our terrific brunch that they weren't doing much business for dinner, I felt somewhat disheartened. As I alluded to at the start of this review, the plaza where OLS resides has a number of empty storefronts. It would be a shame if this cool, bantam canteen closes along with the department store and supermarket before it. So, my sermon to the local foodiesphere on this gleaming Sunday is to let the \"secret\" slip; if your area chuckwagon is too busy to accommodate you on a weekend morn (say Dor-Stop's got a 45 minute wait in effect), drive over to Pleasant Hills for a most pleasant brunch, and be sure to tell everyone in your circle to follow you there. These folks could use the commerce. \n\nP.S. Our Little Secret also caters (duh!), serves cocktails (for dinner only, but they made an exception for a regular who was having a Bloody Mary with his breakfast), and has a interesting \"take out meal plan\" (go to the website for details).","useful":15,"funny":13,"cool":12,"type":"review"}

He ate 2\/3 of his food and brought home most of the pancake and some of his bacon.  I was excited to see Biscuits & Gravy on the menu so I ordered those. I hadn't read the menu but it tells that they come with eggs and hash browns. I ordered my eggs scrambled and they were very good. The has browns could have used another minute or two of cooking but they were also good. I ordered a side of bacon. It was more chewy than crunchy.

I was saving the best for last. I took a bite and something wasn't quite right. I was trying to figure out what was different. On my second bite I figured it out. They had used sweet Italian sausage instead of breakfast sausage. And thought it was supposed to be a white-ish country gravy it was almost brown and tasted like a brown gravy. I was disappointed.

Don't get me wrong, they were good but, don't expect a clean sweet taste here, which is fine with me not liking things too sweet.  \nThe sausage wasn't too greasy, which I appreciated, and after eating 1.5 of the 4 French Toasts and ¼ of the sausage, I was done.\n\nThankfully they let us pay, without me having to touch the kitchen or a dirty dish. \n\nIf you find yourself here, remember to share... The pancakes, as I saw at the table next to us, come in 4s too.  \nOr, order an egg dish, these seemed more \"normal\" size and looked good!  \nOne thing is for sure, you will start your day full and ready for whatever it brings after having one of their breakfasts.","useful":10,"funny":5,"cool":7,"type":"review"}

I came here for birthday breakfast with my family after reading the stellar reviews on here. Another win for the Yelp community. The food was amazing and unbelievably affordable.\nOne of the great things about this place is that the menu includes pancakes, waffles, french toast, and crepes. I don't know a lot of breakfast places that serve all of those options. Not only do they have each of those options, but there are a variety of options for each. They also, of course, have a variety of savory dishes, omelets, and benedict.\nWe arrived a little after 11am (they are only open until 12:30pm), and the place was still pretty full, but we were able to sit down right away. I ordered the crab cake benedict after reading all the good reviews on here and I was not disappointed. I am a huge fan of hollandaise sauce and not only was this sauce delicious, there was PLENTY of it. The crab cakes were delicious and the eggs were perfectly poached. My dad ordered the french toast because I promised him this place was legit. He usually won't order french toast from restaurants because he is always disappointed, but he gave this his seal of approval, and I have to agree. Delicious. My boyfriend ordered the steak omelet. All I have to say is: wow. This omelet was HUGE and came with big chunks of real steak overflowing out of the omelet. Although they didn't ask how he wanted the steak cooked, he commented that it was cooked perfectly and said it was delicious(I don't eat steak, so I can't say first hand). My mom and sister both got the regular eggs benedict and were similarly blown away. \n\nThe only thing I really wasn't blown away by--and this is a personal preference thing--was the crepes. My boyfriend and I split a strawberry cream crepe. The strawberries were delicious and the cream was to die for, but I was just not a fan of the crepe itself. It was a little too fluffy and rich for my taste and didn't have that slight crisp that I have come to appreciate from other favorite breakfast spots in the city. It was very tasty and we ate all of it, it just wasn't my style. \n\nI live in the  south hills and I usually travel into Pittsburgh for a good meal but this place is sure to be a staple in my life from now on. I cannot believe how delicious and affordable this place is. I can't wait to go back and try something new.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Initially I saw Dr. Gomez, and she was able to do the work I needed to not be in pain without pushing other treatment that would have cost too much given my insurance at the time.  When I was in a position to have more work done, I began a long term plan of action to fix all of the existing problems with my teeth, and am about half-way though.  I have mostly worked with Dr. Ibrahim during recent visits, and he is just as friendly and capable as Dr. Gomez.  This is the longest I've ever stuck with a single dental practice, and even after moving an hour away, I have made all of my appointments here and will continue to do so.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}
