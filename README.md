# Social-Restaurant-Recommendation
UVa CS6501-12 Advanced Information Retrieval Course Project

## Introduction

This is a course project for the class Information Retrieval, which is inspired by this paper [Social Collaborative Viewpoint Regression with Explainable Recommendations](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1e7d/7f76b3a7b494122f40c22487e60a51a2d1be.pdf). We aim to build a demo web-based system which you can pick up a location and based on the algorithm introduced in that paper, we will provide an explainable (with topics) restaurant recommendation for you according to not only your review history and others review history but also your social network information.
