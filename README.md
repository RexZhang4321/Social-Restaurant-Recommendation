# Social-Restaurant-Recommendation
UVa CS6501-12 Advanced Information Retrieval Course Project

## Introduction

This is a course project for the class Information Retrieval, which is inspired by this paper [Social Collaborative Viewpoint Regression with Explainable Recommendations](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1e7d/7f76b3a7b494122f40c22487e60a51a2d1be.pdf). We aim to build a demo web-based system which you can pick up a location and based on the algorithm introduced in that paper, we will provide an explainable (with topics) restaurant recommendation for you according to not only your review history and others review history but also your social network information.

## Timeline

| Time      |     Task |   Misc   |
| :-------- | :--------| :------: |
| 3/17 - 3/24    | Review the paper again and do the related background research |  Could be shorter if everything goes well  |
| 3/24 - 4/12 | Realize the initial algorithm, tune the tackle problems, build a backend demo | Di and Jingxuan will work on this |
| 3/24 - 4/7 | Building the front-end application, confirm APIs and make sure it can work separately | Di, Jingxuan and Yina will all work on the solution for front-end application |
| 4/7 - 4/12 | For front-end, explore the possibility in building a mobile application, or help with the backend application | Labor load balance |
| 4/12 - 4/21 | Bridge the front-end and back-end | May new features be added |
| 4/21 - 4/28 | Report and presentation preparation | Clean code and ready to submit |

## Progress

- *3/24* Read through the whole paper.
- *3/26* Our group discussed the relations inside the model, and got some intuition.
- *3/29* Researched the LDA, Gibbs sampling, several distribution and Collaborative Filtering.
